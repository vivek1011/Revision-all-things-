dfs / bfs - PT07Y(is it a tree) 
diameter of a tree - PT07Z
how to find a cycle in a graph using parent call.(indirected graph)
/////////learn for directed 
bfs - LUCKYNUM/ONEZERO  , BITMAP (2-D matrix me bfs chalana) ; 

spoj - TOPOSORT - select vertex with indegree =0 and decrease all its adjacency list by 1
and repeat the same . 

Floyd warshall , all pair shortest path - 
fl( Intermediate vertex )
 fl ( Source Vertex )
    fl(destination vertex) Minimise; 
    
Dijkstra - EZDIJKST spoj 
codeforces - select what edges during the dij - http://codeforces.com/contest/545/submission/11269944
if(Dis[destination] == D[destination adjacency] + edgeweight)
// pick only one edge of minimum weight. 
// this is one of the picked edges . 

IMPORTANT -  
TWO things in one traversal . 
STRONGLY CONNECTED COMPONENTS - (kisi bhi vertex se kisi bhi vertex pe pahunch sakta hun.)
HOW TO FIND A CYCLE IN A DIRECTED GRAPH(see AC solution on toposort on spoj )
http://codeforces.com/contest/427/submission/12733090 - how to traverse only those paths which contain a cycle .
